3,"Get a cash advance You can get cash advances up to your available cash limit. Cash advances are convenient, but it's important to understand how they work before requesting one.
  What is a cash advance? A cash advance is when you use your credit card to obtain cash, such as from an ATM or bank branch.  But there are others types of transactions that are also considered cash advances, such as using your credit card to: transfer money to friends using apps like PayPal, Venmo or Moneygram, pay a debt (such as a car loan) using a third-party bill pay service, buy casino chips or lottery tickets, or exchange dollars for foreign currency. Know the cost: Cash advances usually include transaction fees and a higher APR than credit card purchases. With each cash advance, we charge a front-end fee, or service charge, that posts to your account the day of the transaction. Be sure to review your account terms for details.
 
Things work a little differently when it comes to how payments are applied to cash advances. Check out your account terms so you'll know what to expect. Know your cash advance limit and available credit for cash advances: Look at your most recent credit card statement and find your Cash Advance Limit. Keep in mind, sometimes ATMs have additional limits.  You also must have sufficient total credit line available to take a cash advance.  For example, if you have used all of your available credit for purchases, you cannot take a cash advance, even if you have not used all of your cash advance line. To get a cash advance at an ATM with your Personal Identification Number (PIN): Follow the cash advance instructions displayed on the ATM Make sure you understand any fees that the ATM might charge in addition to those outlined in your account terms before completing the transaction How to get a cash advance if you don’t have your PIN You can take a cash advance inside a bank lobby that displays the Visa or MasterCard credit card logo. You’ll just need to provide a government issued photo ID like a driver's license along with your Capital One card.
 
Forgot your PIN? You can request a new one. It usually takes several days for your PIN to arrive in the mail, but you might be eligible to get one instantly by requesting it online.

6,"Dispute a credit charge Get detailed support to dispute a credit card transaction. Español What is a dispute? If you believe there is an error with a charge on your credit card account or an aspect of your periodic statement, explore these options to resolve the issue as quickly as possible. 

A credit card dispute is a process in which you assert that there is a billing error on your account or that a merchant did not honor their terms and conditions.  Although this can include instances of unauthorized use, typically dispute issues or errors are with merchants that are authorized to charge your credit card. A dispute is not the same as requesting a refund from the merchant, which you should do in situations where you want your money back. For example, you should not dispute a purchase if you want to cancel plans or if you're dissatisfied with what you received. Capital One can't issue refunds on behalf of merchants. A merchant dispute is not the same as an unauthorized charge.  In a merchant dispute, you recognize the transaction and you authorized the merchant to charge your card, but there’s an issue with the service, the amount of the charge, or the merchandise (for example, quality, missing items, or service wasn’t provided).  In contrast, with disputes involving fraud, you and the users on your account do not recognize the transaction or merchant, or you or the users on your account did not authorize the merchant to charge your credit card.] If you file a dispute about a transaction with a merchant, Capital One asks the merchant to review the disputed charge and its associated terms and conditions.  How to file a dispute What should I do first if I have a problem with an authorized charge?   Double-check charges
Before you dispute a charge, do a quick double-check: Make sure the charge has posted to your credit card account. Capital One is unable to dispute a transaction while it is in a pending status. Enroll in Online Banking or download the mobile app to manage your account and keep an eye on pending and posted transactions.  Check with other people authorized to use the credit card account to make sure they didn't make the charge. For example, your authorized user may have charged your shared account while on a business trip before you have all the details. Check your receipts—it’s easy to confuse similar charges or forget about tips. Sometimes a recent charge is a free trial or a recurring billing service you signed up for. You will need to cancel your free trial or recurring billing service with the merchant to prevent future charges from these merchants.  If you still don’t think the transaction is right after checking with your authorized users, looking at pending and posted amounts and automatic billing, you can submit a dispute online. Start with the merchant
  Working directly with the merchant is often the fastest way to resolve your dispute. Merchants are sometimes willing to resolve a concern, even if it’s outside of their policy or terms.

When filing a claim through Capital One, and the merchant contests it, we may need to show that they violated their policies and terms that were agreed upon. That process can take up to 90 days and may require that you supply additional documentation.  Here are some tips for contacting the merchant:
  Keep all documentation from the merchant regarding any cancellation or refund. If this dispute concerns a subscription, make sure you ask the merchant to cancel the subscription and any future charges. If you’re contacting the merchant via email or mail, you could use a message like this:

Hi [name of company],

I purchased [item or service] for [price] on [date].

I would like a refund of [full $ amount or partial $ amount] because [description of problem]. [Optional: I would also like to cancel any future services related to this purchase].

Attached are copies of [description of information you are including] that document this problem.

Please let me know if you need any additional information to process this request.

Thank you,
[Your name]
[Contact Information]
  If you cannot reach a resolution with the merchant, your best chance of resolving the dispute through Capital One is to file a claim within 60 days of the date of your billing statement. Let us know as soon as you can so we can dispute the charge on your behalf.  What happens when you file a dispute through Capital One It can take up to 90 days for Capital One to resolve a dispute with the merchant.
  Here’s what we’ll do: We’ll manage communications with the merchant during the dispute process. When you file a dispute, we may provide a temporary credit on your credit card account for the disputed amount and related fees and interest.  We might also place a hold on your available credit for the same amount.  We might remove the hold before review of the dispute is finished, but you may ultimately be responsible for the disputed amount and have the temporary credit removed. Here’s an overview of what happens after you file a dispute: We may request additional documentation from you related to the dispute. This can include receipts, information about your attempts to return and/or cancel, emails between you and the merchant, and communications with the merchant to try to resolve the issue.   Make sure you hang onto all of your documentation until your dispute is resolved.  In most cases, we send information about the purchase and why you’re disputing it to the merchant and the merchant’s bank via Visa or Mastercard. In those cases, the merchant either accepts the dispute or rejects the dispute and tells us why. If the merchant rejects the dispute, we will review their response.  Responsibility for the disputed amount is based primarily on the merchant’s policies and terms concerning the sale. You’ll also have the opportunity to submit additional documents and refute their response. If we conclude that you are responsible, we will remove the temporary credit, and the original charge will be re-applied to your account. If the merchant is found responsible, we will make the temporary credit permanent. What to do if the dispute charge is reapplied to your account We understand that having a disputed charge reapplied to your account might not be the outcome you were hoping for. Capital One provides you a temporary credit for the original charge  and any related fees and interest while we investigate your dispute. If the merchant provides information demonstrating that the original charge is valid—or that they gave you a credit for it—we add the charge back to your account (by reversing the temporary credit) and end our investigation. The charge will appear on your account and statement as a “purchase adjustment.” Depending on your paperless enrollment status, you’ll receive a follow-up letter, either online or in the mail within 7-10 days, that provides more details. 
 
The letter we send you should provide information on what steps are still available to you if you're dissatisfied with the dispute resolution. The letter will list the additional documentation you’ll need to continue your dispute and how to submit that documentation to us via fax, mail or a secure link. You can obtain a secure link by calling us.  While you wait for the letter, we encourage you to gather documentation that might be helpful, such as receipts, evidence of making a return or any communication from the merchant promising a refund.
 
And remember: you can always try to resolve your dispute and get your money back by working with the merchant directly.

Will a credit line increase request impact my credit score? If you request a credit limit increase from Capital One, it won’t harm your credit score because we only do a soft inquiry. Are all Capital One card holders eligible for a credit line increase? No, some accounts may not be eligible for an increased credit line upon request. The reasons for ineligibility vary, but broadly speaking, the following accounts are usually ineligible: New accounts opened within the past several months Secured credit cards Accounts that have received a credit line increase or decrease over the past several months Even if your account does not fall into one of these categories, your credit line increase  request may still be declined for other reasons. What factors contribute to a denial of a credit line increase request? While the reasons behind a denial may vary, common reasons why your request for a credit line increase may be declined include:  Your Capital One account is too new There has recently been a change to the credit line on this account This Capital One account was recently past due Your average monthly payment has been too low Recent usage of this account's existing credit line has been too low The credit reporting agency has reported a recent credit delinquency Your current credit score is too low What factors does Capital One consider when reviewing my request for an increased credit limit? The following list are examples of factors we consider when determining your request for a credit limit increase: If you make on-time payments (with all creditors) If you make larger monthly payments that pay down your balance Changes in your employment status, total annual income, or credit score Usage of your current credit line Your account age and recency of your last credit line change How often can I request a credit line increase? You may request a credit line increase anytime you like. Are there fees associated with requesting a credit line increase? There are no fees associated with requesting a credit line increase. How long does a request take to be reviewed?  Sometimes your new limit is approved immediately. Other times, it can take a few days. In certain instances, we'll send you a letter by mail with details about the decision. Do I need to accept a credit line increase offer? No, you have the option to decline the offer we present to you. In addition, we will give you the option to choose a lower credit line increase amount if that works better for you. "

To see if you have available airline travel credits, sign into Capital One Travel and go to the My Trips page. Keep in mind that Capital One Travel is bound by the airline’s rules and restrictions and can only redeem airline travel credits according to the terms and conditions of the airline. Here are a few things to be aware of: If you booked with a low-cost carrier—like Spirit Airlines or Ryanair—the booking is managed by the airline. Contact the airline directly for more information about possible travel credits. Airline travel credits typically aren’t offered for basic economy bookings. Airline travel credits might expire after a certain period of time, according to the rules set by the airline. The airline credit can only be used by the same passengers on the same airline as the original booking. The airline credit might not be able to be applied to certain flights.  By contrast, Capital One travel credits are a form of payment issued by Capital One that you may apply to future purchases on Capital One Travel. Do travel credits expire?

For example, if your travel credit is worth more than the total cost of a trip you’re booking, you will keep any remaining travel credit balance to use later. Alternatively, if your travel credit is worth less than the total cost of your booking, you’ll need to use your eligible Capital One credit card or Capital One rewards to pay the remaining balance.

11,"How to freeze the price of a flight Freeze the price of a flight for a specific time to land a great deal with Capital One Travel. Here’s how. Want a little extra time before you decide to book a flight? For some flights offered through Capital One Travel, you can “freeze” the price for a specific period of time by paying a small fee. Freezing the price of a flight will give you some extra time to plan your trip—and you won’t have to stress about the price potentially going up.   When you freeze the price of the flight, Capital One Travel will hold that price for you until the expiration date of your frozen price. That expiration date will be given to you before completing your purchase. If the price of the flight increases after you freeze it (and before your frozen price expires), Capital One Travel will cover any fare increase up to the maximum amount, which will also be given to you before completing your purchase. If the price goes down, you pay the lower price. Here's how to freeze the price of a flight: 1. Sign in to Capital One Travel and search for a flight. 2. On the flight results page, select Freeze price. Or, if you prefer, select your flights first and then select Freeze this price on the Review Itinerary page (if available). 3. If you selected Freeze price from the flights results page, click Continue if you want to select the suggested flights or Choose another flight to select your own set of flights to freeze. 4. Choose the duration of your price freeze. Images of mobile experience for illustration only. User experience and fee details may vary. 5. Ensure the details are correct and then follow the on-screen instructions to complete your booking. After you purchase your price freeze, you can view your price freeze details in your confirmation email or by following these steps: 1. Sign in to Capital One Travel and click the menu button in the top right-hand corner. 2. Select My Trips. 3. Select the Frozen Prices tab to view your frozen flights and proceed to booking. If your frozen price has not expired but there aren't enough seats available when you try to book, Capital One Travel will give you the option to apply your freeze to a similar flight if available, or you can get a refund for your price freeze fee. Similar flights will have the exact same dates, origin and destination as the flight you froze. As long as your freeze hasn't expired, your original frozen price and the remaining duration of the freeze will be transferred to the similar flight you select. Capital One Travel will also cover the price difference up to the maximum service cap that was specified when you froze the price. Need more help? Check out all Capital One Travel help topics or give us a call at 844-422-6922. When do frozen prices expire? The expiration date and time are specified when you pay to freeze the price, which you can see in the Frozen Prices tab of the My Trips page any time. If you decide to book the flight after the frozen price expires, you’ll pay the airline’s current price.   What happens after I freeze a flight price? You’ll receive a confirmation email when you freeze a flight price. The email will specify your maximum refund amount as well as the expiration date and time of your frozen price. How many passengers is the price freeze valid for? The frozen price is valid only for the number of passengers you indicated when you paid to freeze the price. If you freeze the price for multiple passengers, you’ll need to book for all the passengers in order to purchase your tickets at the frozen price. For example, if you freeze the price for five passengers, you must book for all five. And if fewer than five seats are available, the flight is considered unavailable for you to book.  Can I freeze the price of a flight for a child? Due to airline contracts, Capital One Travel can’t support any bookings in which the only traveler is younger than 18 years old. This means you can’t book a frozen trip price for a minor traveling alone. Support | Short Read"
12,"Manage your rental car booking Learn how to manage your rental car bookings through Capital One Travel, including changes and cancellations. How to change your rental car reservation The easiest way to change your booking is usually to cancel and make a new reservation. Canceling and rebooking also works if you prepaid some or all of a refundable reservation.   Keep in mind that all change requests are subject to rental car availability. You may have to pay cancellation or change fees, depending on the rental car provider’s policies.  All eligible rental car refunds are sent back to the original payment method. You typically receive your refund within one or two billing cycles.  Here’s how refunds works by payment method:  Capital One rewards only: Your refund will be returned entirely as rewards.  Credit card only: Your refund will be issued back to your card account.  A combination of rewards and your credit card: You’ll be refunded in both rewards and on your credit card, proportionally to how you originally paid. Here’s an example: If your original payment was 60% on your credit card and 40% rewards, a $100 refund would be returned as $60 credit to your card and $40 worth of rewards.  Capital One travel credit: If you used a travel credit to pay for some or all of your booking, you’ll receive that same amount back in travel credit for future use. If a purchase made using an annual travel credit is canceled after the expiration date of the credit, the credit will not be restored. When to contact the rental car provider directly to request a change If you don’t want to cancel and rebook your reservation, you need to contact the rental car provider directly to request any changes. How to cancel your rental car reservation Some, but not all, rental car bookings are refundable and can be canceled through Capital One Travel. Follow the steps below to cancel your reservation. 1. Sign in to Capital One Travel and click the menu button in the top right-hand corner. 2. Select My Trips. 3. Click on your upcoming trip to view more details. 4. Select Cancel Car Rental. 5.
